Merge Sorted Array - LeetCode (Day - 6 of #100daysCodingChallenge - DSA)

Hey i have skipped a day in my #100daysCodingChallenge, but get on to track to solve problems. Yesterday i had solved Merge Sorted Array problem, in which we have to merge two arrays of m elements and n elements and sort them in non-decreasing order. 

I followed brute force approach to merge them using two for loops and sorted them using bubble sort technique. But they asked to solve it in O(m+n) times. But i have solved it in O(n^2). Will try optimal solution later and update here when i did it!
